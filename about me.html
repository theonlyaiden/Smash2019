		<center>	<p>Hey! My name is Aiden Lambotte. I'm 15 years old and I'm from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm part of a family of four: my mom, my dad, and my younger 12-year-old brother. I live next to Six Flags so I tend to go there often. My brother has a pet gecko named Lynda who is our 4th real pet.</p>
		<p>My favorite musical artist is Lil Uzi Vert. I love to draw. I also like shopping for clothes and running. My style in clothes is heavily influenced from artists like XXXTENTACION, Lil Uzi Vert, Trippe Redd, Juice WRLD, and PnB Rock. My favorite color is red and my favorite place to eat is Chik-fil-A. When I grow up I want to be a visual artist or go to school to become a chef. I want to be apart of my high school's track team in the near future.</p> </center>
